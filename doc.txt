​
Pre-requisites
Create a Cashfree Merchant Account.
Log in to the Merchant Dashboard and generate App ID and Secret Key. Learn how to generate API keys.
Ensure you have whitelisted your website domain for integration. Read more about Domain Whitelisting.
The web checkout integration consists of three essential steps:
Creating an order.
Opening the checkout page.
Confirming the payment.
The step-by-step guide for each step of the integration process is as follows:
​
Step 1: Creating an order
To integrate the Cashfree Payment Gateway, the first step is to create an order. This must be done before any payment processing can occur. Set up an endpoint on your server to handle order creation as you cannot call this API from client side.
Order creation must be done through your backend, as this API requires your secret key. It should not be called directly from the client-side.
API request for creating an order
Here’s a sample request for creating an order using your desired backend language. Cashfree offers backend SDKs to simplify the integration process.

javascript

python

java

go

csharp

php

curl

Copy

Ask AI
import { Cashfree, CFEnvironment } from "cashfree-pg";

const cashfree = new Cashfree(
	CFEnvironment.PRODUCTION,
	"{Client ID}",
	"{Client Secret Key}"
);

function createOrder() {
	var request = {
		order_amount: "1",
		order_currency: "INR",
		customer_details: {
			customer_id: "node_sdk_test",
			customer_name: "",
			customer_email: "example@gmail.com",
			customer_phone: "9999999999",
		},
		order_meta: {
			return_url:
				"https://test.cashfree.com/pgappsdemos/return.php?order_id=order_123",
		},
		order_note: "",
	};

	cashfree
		.PGCreateOrder(request)
		.then((response) => {
			var a = response.data;
			console.log(a);
		})
		.catch((error) => {
			console.error("Error setting up order request:", error.response.data);
		});
}
After successfully creating an order, you will receive a unique order_id and payment_session_id that you need for subsequent steps.
You can view all the complete API request and response for /orders here.
​
Step 2: Opening the checkout page
This step requires you to whitelist your domain with Cashfree.
​
1. Include JS SDK in your client code
To integrate the Cashfree checkout, you must include our JavaScript SDK within your JS file.

CDN

NPM

Copy

Ask AI
npm install @cashfreepayments/cashfree-js
​
2. Initialise the SDK
You need to initialise the variable using the Cashfree() function.
There are two modes applicable for this: sandbox or production.
Sandbox is used for a test environment, whereas production is used for production mode.

CDN

NPM

Copy

Ask AI
const cashfree = await load({
	mode: "sandbox" //or production
});
//This load function returns a Promise that resolves with a newly created Cashfree object once Cashfree.js has loaded. If you call load in a server environment it will resolve to null.
​
3. Open Cashfree checkout
To open the checkout, you can use the cashfree.checkout() method. This method can take in the following parameters :
paymentSessionId: Received from Create Order response.
redirectTarget (optional): This parameter decides how the payment page will open up.You can provide the following values:
Property Value	Description
_self(default)	Opens the payment link in the same frame as it was clicked.
_blank	Opens the payment link in a new window or tab.
_top	Opens the linked document in the full body of the window.
_modal	Opens the payment link in a pop-up window on the current page.
DOM element	Opens the payment link directly within a specified DOM element.
Checkout Variants
Redirect checkout : For redirectTarget _self, _blank, _top
Popup checkout: For redirectTarget _modal
Inline checkout: For redirectTarget DOM element
When using pop-up and inline checkout, the approach varies slightly. You need to manage the promise returned by cashfree.checkout() to execute any additional code following the payment attempt.

                    redirectTarget: "_self",
                };
                cashfree.checkout(checkoutOptions);
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
​
Step 3: Confirming the payment
Once the payment is completed, you need to confirm whether the payment was successful by checking the order status.
Redirect checkout
Once the payment process finishes, the user will be redirected to the return URL you provided during order creation (Step 1). If no return URL is provided, customers will be redirected to Cashfree’s default page.
We recommend that you provide a return URL while creating an order. This will improve the overall user experience by ensuring your customers don’t land on broken or duplicated pages. Also, remember to add context of the order in your return URL so that you can identify the order once the customer has returned to this URL.
Popup and inline checkout
Once the payment process finishes, the cashfree.checkout() function returns a promise which should be handled by the merchant.
​
Order status verification
To verify an order you can call our /pg/orders endpoint from your backend. You can also use our SDK to achieve the same.

golang

javascript

php

java

python

csharp

curl

Copy

Ask AI
version := "2023-08-01"
response, httpResponse, err := cashfree.PGFetchOrder(&version, "<order_id>", nil, nil, nil)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err.Error())
} else {
	fmt.Println(httpResponse.StatusCode)
	fmt.Println(response)
}
Before delivering services to the customer, always verify the status of the order, which can be done using the Get Order API. An order is considered successful when the order_status is PAID.
​
Testing
You should now have a working checkout button that opens the Cashfree-hosted payment page. If your integration isn’t working, try the following steps:
Open the Network tab in your browser’s developer tools.
Click the button and check the console logs.
Ensure that the correct environment and payment session ID are being passed.
Use console.log() inside your button click listener to confirm whether the data is being passed correctly or not. Overview

Cashfree Element Integration makes it easy to add secure payment features to web apps. By including the Cashfree SDK with a simple script tag, developers can use ready-made payment components that are safe and compliant with security standards. These customizable elements can be embedded directly into the app, simplifying the payment process while ensuring flexibility and ease of use. The setup is quick, requiring minimal effort, and ensures a secure, efficient payment experience.
To get started, include the cashfree.js library in your website. To be PCI compliant, you must load cashfree.js directly from https://sdk.cashfree.com. You cannot include it in a bundle or host it yourself. To always use a specific version you will have to include the version in this way:

Copy

Ask AI
<script src="https://sdk.cashfree.com/js/v3/cashfree.js"></script>
If you’re using Svelte or React, refer to the SDK documentation for more details.
​
Async and Deferred Loading
Asynchronous loading of JavaScript is generally recommended, as it can improve the user experience of your site by not blocking DOM rendering during script loading.
You can also load cashfree.js using the async or defer attribute on the script tag. Kindly note that with asynchronous loading, any API calls will have to be made only after the script execution has finished.

Customize a Component                        Component Customization

Open in ChatGPT

Understand how to customize a component as per your requirements

Each Cashfree.js component is initialized with a configuration object that allows you to customize both its behavior and appearance. The configuration object helps you seamlessly integrate the component with your application’s design system.
​
Basic Usage

Copy

Ask AI
// Initialize component with configuration
const options = {
	// Configuration options here
};

// Create and mount the component
const cardNumber = cashfree.create("cardNumber", options);
cardNumber.mount("#cardnumber");
​
Configuration Options

Copy

Ask AI
const cardNumberOptions = {
	classes: {
		base: "my-input",
		focus: "input-focused",
		invalid: "input-error",
		complete: "input-complete",
	},
	fonts: [
		{
			family: "Roboto",
			src: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto",
		},
	],
	style: {
		base: {
			color: "#333",
			fontSize: "16px",
			fontFamily: "Roboto, sans-serif",
			padding: "12px",
			backgroundColor: "#fff",
			border: "1px solid #ccc",
			borderRadius: "4px",
		},
		focus: {
			borderColor: "#0066cc",
		},
		invalid: {
			borderColor: "#ff3333",
			color: "#ff3333",
		},
	},
	disabled: false,
	loader: true,
};

const cardNumber = cashfree.create("cardNumber", cardNumberOptions);
cardNumber.mount("#card-number-container");
Notes:
All configuration options are optional. Components will use default styles if not specified.
The style object supports most CSS properties in camelCase format.
Custom fonts specified in the fonts array are loaded automatically before the component renders.
Use the disabled option to temporarily prevent user interaction (e.g., during form submission).
The loader option can be used to show/hide loading states while the component initializes
​
classes
Type: object
You can use classes which is an object that will have names of classes. The classes you specify will be applied to DOM container where the component is mounted. You have to make sure that these are present in your application css .
Please note that you do not have to add the classes to your DOM container. The sdk will do it when required.
​
Default values

Copy

Ask AI
{
	"base": "cf-base-private",
	"complete": "cf-complete-private",
	"empty": "cf-empty-private",
	"focus": "cf-focus-private",
	"invalid": "cf-invalid-private",
	"disabled": "cf-disabled-private"
}
​
base
The string you provide as a value of base will be applied to the container. This is the base class. If you do not provide a value of base, default value of cf-base-private will be applied.

Copy

Ask AI
let options = {
	classes: {
		base: "my-base",
	},
};
Your css file

Copy

Ask AI
.my-base {
	padding: 5px;
}
Your HTML

Copy

Ask AI
<div class="base" id="mount-here"></div>
In this case a padding of 5px will be added to your container once a component is mounted
​
complete
A complete class will be applied to the container when the component you have mounted has been completed by the customer. This is relevant for example in card number input box when the user has entered a valid card number you would want to make the border of your container green. Default is cf-complete-private.
Please note that not all components will have apply a complete class to your container.
Example
Your js file

	classes: {
		complete: "my-complete",
	},
};
Your css file

Example
Your js file

Copy

Ask AI
let options = {
	classes: {
		focus: "my-focus",
	},
};
Your css file

Copy

Ask AI
.my-empty {
	transform: translateY(-5px);
}
When focussed the container will move up by 5px
​

Example
Your js file

Copy

Ask AI
let options = {
	classes: {
		invalid: "my-invalid",
	},
};
Your css file

Copy

Ask AI

Once you have the components ready you will need to pass on these components along with the payment_session_idto cashfree.js. Here is an example of a payment options. You can see there are three properties to it:
paymentMethod: This is the component which will be used for the payment.
paymentSessionId: This is the payment_session_id which you get once you have created an order.
Other attributes likes returnUrl, savePaymentInstrument etc.

Copy

Ask AI
let paymentOptions = {
	paymentMethod: component,
	paymentSessionId: "your-payment-session-id",
	savePaymentInstrument: true,
};
​
paymentOptions
​
paymentMethod
objectrequired
A reference to a payable component. Kindly note that the payable component should be ready and complete before invoking pay on it, otherwise it will throw an error. To get if a payable component is complete or not you can use component.isComplete() which returns a bool.
There are scenarios when one component also requires other components, in that case you will have to also check the completeness of those other component. Example- to process card you would need to make sure cardNumber, cardExpiry, cardCvv and cardHolder are all complete.
​
paymentSessionId
stringrequired
To make payment you will need a paymentSessionId, you can get this by making a create order API call to POST /orders. Please make sure you are using the correct hostname for the environment you want to process the payment for.
In the response of POST /orders you will find payment_session_id. Note that this is a backend call so you will need to have a server. Read how to generate payment_session_id here
​
returnUrl
string
This is the url where your customers will be redirected after they have complete the payment.
​
redirect
string
For certain paymentMethod you can choose to not redirect the customer to the returnUrl by passing if_required. Examples would be Card, UPI and QR. For payment method where redirection is required this flag will be completely ignored. If you decide not to redirect the customer then pay() promise resolves with {paymentDetails: {paymentMessage: "Payment finished. Check status."}}. To confirm the payment it is recommended that you always check the status of your order from your backend server with Cashfree.
​
redirectTarget
string
We also provide a way for you to decide how to redirect your customer. This takes all the values that are valid for hyperlink. Default is _self
Value	Description
_blank	Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self	Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent	Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top	Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
_framename_	Opens the linked document in the named iframe
​
savePaymentInstrument
object
Assign a savePaymentInstrument to this to save the payment method. Works only for card payment. Default is null.

Copy

Ask AI
let saveOptions = {
	values: {
		label: "Save Card for later"
	}
};
let savecard = cashfree.create("savePaymentInstrument", saveOptions);
